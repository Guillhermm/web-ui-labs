# Chess Opera Game Animation Project

A visual chessboard animation recreating Paul Morphy’s Opera Game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project focuses on DOM manipulation, piece animation, and visual storytelling rather than implementing a full chess engine.

**Live demo:** https://codepen.io/guillhermm/pen/dPXOoBq

## Behavior

- The chessboard grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
- Pieces are positioned absolutely and animated using CSS transitions.
- Moves follow a predefined list representing the historical Opera Game.
- Captures fade out captured pieces before removal.
- Castling is handled as a special case with a secondary rook movement.
- Source and destination squares are highlighted on each move.
- The animation plays automatically once the page loads.

## Notes

This is a visual and educational project.
There is no move validation, user interaction, or game logic enforcement.

All moves are scripted to faithfully reproduce Paul Morphy’s famous Opera Game, focusing on presentation and animation clarity rather than chess rules completeness.
