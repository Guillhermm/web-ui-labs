# Calculator

A simple calculator interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project focuses on layout, visual feedback, and direct DOM manipulation rather than advanced mathematical features.

## Behavior

- Numbers and operators are appended as plain strings.
- The display prevents leading zeroes.
- The percentage operator (`%`) is handled by converting it to `/100`.
- Expressions are evaluated using `eval()` for simplicity.

## Notes

This is an experimental UI project.  
The logic is intentionally minimal and does not cover complex or invalid expressions.
