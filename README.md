# Web UI Labs

A collection of small frontend UI experiments built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository serves as a sandbox for testing visual structure, interaction patterns, and simple logic.  
Each experiment lives in its own directory and can be run independently.

No frameworks. No build tools. No dependencies.

## Experiments

- **Calculator**  
  A basic calculator interface focused on layout and direct DOM interaction.  
  **Path:** `calculator/`

- **Chess Opera Game Animation**
  A visual chessboard animation recreating Paul Morphy’s famous Opera Game, focused on piece animation and scripted move playback rather than game logic.  
  **Path:** `chess-opera-game-animation/`

- **Houdini Chromatic Wheel**
  An experimental generative art piece using the CSS Houdini Paint API to render an animated, interactive chromatic wheel, with a Canvas fallback for unsupported browsers.  
  **Path:** `houdini-chromatic-wheel/`

- **Prime Binary Display**  
  A visual exploration of prime numbers represented in binary form.  
  **Path:** `prime-binary-display/`

- **Primes**
  A 2048-inspired puzzle game built around prime numbers, featuring custom merge rules, dynamic prime generation, tile persistence via localStorage, responsive touch controls, and adaptive UI scaling.  
  **Path:**`primes/`

## Notes

These projects are experimental by nature and are not intended as production-ready components.
