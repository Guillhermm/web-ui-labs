# Web UI Labs

A collection of small frontend UI experiments built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository serves as a sandbox for testing visual structure, interaction patterns, and simple logic.  
Each experiment lives in its own directory and can be run independently.

No frameworks. No build tools. No dependencies.

## Experiments

- **Calculator**  
  A basic calculator interface focused on layout and direct DOM interaction.  
  **Path:** `calculator/`

- **Chess Opera Game Animation**
  A visual chessboard animation recreating Paul Morphy’s famous Opera Game, focused on piece animation and scripted move playback rather than game logic.
  **Path:** `chess-opera-game-animation/`

- **Prime Binary Display**  
  A visual exploration of prime numbers represented in binary form.  
  **Path:** `prime-binary-display/`

## Notes

These projects are experimental by nature and are not intended as production-ready components.
