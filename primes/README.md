# Primes

A puzzle game inspired by the classic 2048, reimagined with prime numbers and custom merge rules, built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project focuses on algorithmic logic, grid-based movement, dynamic number generation, animations, and mobile-friendly interactions rather than traditional arithmetic merging.

## Behavior

- The game is played on a 4×4 grid generated in HTML and managed via JavaScript.
- Tiles spawn with prime numbers (2 or 3) and slide in four directions using keyboard or swipe input.
- Tiles may merge in groups of **2 or 3 consecutive tiles**.
- A merge is only valid if the sum is either a prime number or in case it does not exceed the current **Next** target prime.
- Prime numbers beyond the initial predefined list are generated dynamically at runtime.
- Tile colors are assigned by tier and scale visually as primes grow.
- Font size adapts automatically to fit large prime values inside tiles.
- Smooth animations are used for tile movement, spawning, and merging.
- The game tracks current score and best score, highest prime achieved and best prime, and total moves.
- A medal system (bronze, silver, gold) reflects player progress based on the highest prime reached.
- Game state is automatically persisted using `localStorage`, allowing sessions to resume after a page refresh.
- A rules/info modal explains gameplay mechanics using paginated sections.
- Mobile swipe gestures are fully supported, with native pull-to-refresh disabled while interacting with the board.

## Notes

This is a strategy-focused number puzzle rather than a traditional arithmetic game.

Merging rules are intentionally restrictive, encouraging players to think ahead and plan moves carefully instead of merging freely. The challenge comes from managing prime growth, board space, and merge opportunities.

The project is implemented entirely with vanilla technologies, prioritizing clarity, performance, and maintainability without external libraries or frameworks.
